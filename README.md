# Analysis-of-COVID-19-outbreak-in-India
Analyzing the spread of COVID-19 outbreak in India. Emphasized on the usage of data visualization and data preprocessing (source code.py) and made a final report based on the outbreak.
Also I compare our data with that of Iran. Interestingly, I found that Iran has exponential increase  and standard deviation is less than India. I have separately filed the comparison code between India and Iran.
